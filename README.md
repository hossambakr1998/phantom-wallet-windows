# Phantom Wallet Windows

**Phantom Desktop** is a standalone desktop application designed to work seamlessly with the Solana blockchain. It offers a more flexible and powerful alternative to browser-based wallet interactions — ideal for power users, developers, and crypto traders.

---

## Features

- **Multi-window support** – run multiple isolated wallet instances at the same time.
- **Great for active trading** – especially useful when working with meme coins, new tokens, and Solana dApps.
- **No browser required** – operate independently of your browser or browser profiles.
- **Faster access to dApps** – open and manage wallet sessions in dedicated desktop windows.

## Why use Phantom Desktop?

Browser extensions are convenient, but they come with limitations — like restricted session control and dependence on browser behavior. Phantom Desktop helps you:

- Operate multiple wallets at once
- Avoid logging in/out repeatedly
- Stay organized when using launchpads or trading new tokens
- Separate personal and trading environments with ease

---

## 📈 Use Case: Trading

Phantom Desktop is especially useful for:

- Monitoring multiple Solana wallets side-by-side
- Participating in meme coin launches or low-cap gems
- Running several dApp sessions in parallel
- Managing different accounts for risk separation

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Do I need to have the browser extension installed?
No, Phantom Desktop runs separately and does not require the browser extension.

### Can I use multiple wallets at the same time?
Yes! You can open as many windows as you need — each with its own isolated session.

### Is this secure?
Each window operates independently and uses local session storage. Still, always use with caution and never expose private keys.

### Can I use this with mainnet and devnet?
Yes. Network switching and custom RPC support are planned for upcoming versions.
