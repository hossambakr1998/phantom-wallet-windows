## Why use Phantom Desktop?

Browser extensions are convenient, but they come with limitations — like restricted session control and dependence on browser behavior. Phantom Desktop helps you:

- Operate multiple wallets at once
- Avoid logging in/out repeatedly
- Stay organized when using launchpads or trading new tokens
- Separate personal and trading environments with ease

---

## 📈 Use Case: Trading

Phantom Desktop is especially useful for:

- Monitoring multiple Solana wallets side-by-side
- Participating in meme coin launches or low-cap gems
- Running several dApp sessions in parallel
- Managing different accounts for risk separation

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Do I need to have the browser extension installed?
No, Phantom Desktop runs separately and does not require the browser extension.

### Can I use multiple wallets at the same time?
Yes! You can open as many windows as you need — each with its own isolated session.

### Is this secure?
Each window operates independently and uses local session storage. Still, always use with caution and never expose private keys.

### Can I use this with mainnet and devnet?
Yes. Network switching and custom RPC support are planned for upcoming versions.
